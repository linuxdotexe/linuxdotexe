### 👋 Hey there! I am Sai Nivas Mangu

I'm a CS sophomore and a passionate GNU/Linux user (i use arch btw). I make poor attemps at shell scripting and I run a window manager setup to feel cool. I am a minimalist and I don't like bloat. I want to support and contribute to open-source projects and I am trying to gain enough knowledge to do so.

### Currently I am
- 📖 writing blog posts at [fosse.ml](https://fosse.ml) about FOSS, GNU/Linux and other things (potentially)
- 🌐 trying my hand at webdev
- 📖 reading The Linux Bible
- 📜 trying to learn lua and vimscript

### I want to
- 🔌 make a vim plugin
- 🦀 learn rust
- ⛓️  learn blockchain
- 💡 contribute to open-source projects

I also know how to exit vim.

PS: I usually don't like emojis but this looked too bland without them ;)
