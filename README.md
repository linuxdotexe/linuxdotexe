### 👋 Hey there! I am Sai Nivas Mangu

I'm a CS junior and a passionate GNU/Linux user. I make poor attemps at shell scripting. I am a minimalist and I don't like bloat (but stats are cool). I want to support and contribute to open-source projects and I am trying to gain enough knowledge to do so.

### Currently I am
- 🌐 trying my hand at webdev (me likey JAMStack)
- 🌐 developing small front-end projects with gatsby
- 📖 reading The Linux Bible

### I want to
- 💡 contribute to open-source projects
- 📜 learn DSA

I also know how to exit vim.
