### 👋 Hey there! I am Sai Nivas Mangu

I'm a CS sophomore and a passionate GNU/Linux user (i use arch btw). I make poor attemps at shell scripting and I run a window manager setup to feel cool. I am a minimalist and I don't like bloat (but stats are cool). I want to support and contribute to open-source projects and I am trying to gain enough knowledge to do so.

### Currently I am
- 📖 writing blog posts on [hashnode](https://snm.hashnode.dev) about... stuff?
- 🌐 trying my hand at webdev (me likey JAMStack)
- 📖 reading The Linux Bible

### I want to
- 🔌 make a vim plugin
- 🦀 learn rust
- ⛓️  learn blockchain
- 💡 contribute to open-source projects
- 📜 learn lua and vimscript

I also know how to exit vim.
